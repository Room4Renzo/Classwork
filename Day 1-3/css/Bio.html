        Hey. Names Renzo, I'm 30 and i became interested in computers around the age of 18.
        I had always enjoy playing games and having cool little gadgets but i became interested in computers
        when a 2nd hand one was gifted to me. It worked fine at first but then would'nt switch on. I read building a
        PC for dummies in order to try and fix it. I was soon gifted a second desktop tower, which worked fine too,
        but also stopped working shortly after. I used what i had learned to take parts from the 2nd desktop and replace the parts
        in the 1st, which actually worked. Thus my love for computing was born. It's developed over the years to include more but
        has now landed on coding. Which i just think is super cool, and id love to learn everything i can about it and use it to make cool stuff.            
        </p>
